    <h1>How the Model was made:

        <p> The model was designed using a software program called "Blender". Blender is a program capable of making many animations and objects. The model I decided to design consisted of three main shapes.</div>

    <div class="zach2">
        The first object was a water container. To make this container I had to use many different tools. The first was the shaping tool which allowed me to make the basic shape of the container. After this I decided to use the editing tool in Blender to remove the top face of the container. I then used a modifier which allowed me to solidify the model. After this I made the thickness of the container bigger which allowed me to give the container some charactersistics.<br><br></div>

        <p>
            The next object that I created was the cyclinder which was the output for the water. I used the shaping tool and then the editing tool to make the cyclinder a full object. I then solidified it using the solidfier modifier. Following this I added a cyclinder which I made into the shape of a pipe using the diting tool. This was a difficult task as the editing tool was extremely difficult to use.

        <p>The next task to complete the 3D model was adding walls to the model, this task required me to make a plane and then rotating it. I then shaped it into a large face. I then shaped in editing mode and added two more faces to it. I pulled it out to make the shape around my model. I then added colour to the walls, the water container, the pipe and made the liquid clear by adding a glass finish to it. The final rendered animation looked great and took almost 12 hours to render as it was of such good quality. I was very pleased with the final result.
